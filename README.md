# Mechanical-Efficiency-Calculator
This code is used to find mechanical efficiency.

#Input Parameters
N = rpm
T = Torque(NM)
K = No of cylinders
S = stroke type(2 or 4)
P = Mean effective pressure(N/m^2)
L = Length of stroke(m)
A = Area(m^2)

#Output
Brake power in kw
Indicated power in Kw
Frictional Power in Kw
Mechanical efficiency in percentage (%)
